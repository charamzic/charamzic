### Hello there <a href="http://charamzic.github.io"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/w1OBpBd7kJqHrJnJ13/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>
I just successfully finished a ten-month [Green Fox Academy](https://www.greenfoxacademy.cz/) bootcamp during December 2021 and now I am eager to dive deep into Java and C# - languages we were focusing on during the camp. At the very begining I was all about learning front end and I still want to become more than capable in it, but as I had the chance to peek into back end, I want more.

So the plan is clear, to become a full stack guy! ðŸ¤“
