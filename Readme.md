### Hello there <a href="http://charamzic.github.io"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/w1OBpBd7kJqHrJnJ13/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>

I just successfully finished a ten-month [Green Fox Academy](https://www.greenfoxacademy.cz/) bootcamp during December 2021 and now I am eager to dive deep into **Java and C#** - languages we were focusing on during the camp. At the very begining I was all about learning front end and I still want to become more than capable in it, but as I had the chance to peek into back end, it won me over a bit.

<span style="text-decoration: underline">So the plan is clear, to become a full stack guy!</span> 🤓

I am still in the begining and I keep myself busy learning and immediately trying out new knowledge and skills. My latest projects are bellow and hey, if you think I could fit into your team or something, reach me out.

  <summary><b>😎&nbsp;&nbsp;More&nbsp;About&nbsp;Me</b></summary>
  <br/>

I am 38 yo guy from Prague, currently dedicated to learn to code, switch careers and become a web and app developer. Although I have a better feeling for visual stuff and front end might look as a wise desicion for me, I'd love to continue working with back end as well. So I do work with backend. 😁 It's tough, but rewarding.

Before coding, You would find me somewhere in the mountains, climbing via ferrata with my clients or in the gym, helping them achieve their goals. And now I'm here, merging branches and careers, pushing code and weights. And I love it! Cant't wait till my first dev job opportunity.
